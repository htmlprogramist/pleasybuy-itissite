	<p>This game is about an ordinary robotic man, Diego. 
  He lacks something in life. And so he decided to climb on 
  an old abandoned place in which he came across someone from the
  best to be afraid
  and run away. And if he does not get out with this abandoned, 
  then he will take the place of this monster.</p>
